/*So JavaScript.....What is the heck is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a Scripting language aaeennn Scripting language....what is this scripting language mann now I need to learn about this Scripting language....aahhhh yeasss "We can ! be tired of something we Love😘" so learning about scripting language or diving deep into JavaScript doest not require efforts cause it is something you Love and Love is EFFORTLESS OOpsx (I ammm sorry lets just learn not about Him but About JavaScript)
-> JavaScript was developed by Brenden Eich
-> It was developed for Netscape Navigator and it became Ecma Standard in 1997.
-> JavaScript is a scripting language. with the origin of Scripting languages, web browsers started implementing scripting engines within themselves this is resulted in confusion and hence ECMA International came up with an idea of standardizing scripting language this lead to the formulation of ECMA Script.
ECMA stands for European Computer Manufacturer Association!
(Fyn simple aara na samajh me....kya yaaro simple 3 points hai na clear! thodi history hai bhai JavaScript ki....history ku kissi ka past hai sonch k padhe toh zyada samjhme aate chezein if you know You know😜)
-> The attributes and features of JavaScript are standard to ECMA script.
-> It also has additional features which do not belong to ECMAScript.
-> JavaScript is used alongside with Html and CSS and together are considerd to be the pillars of world wide web. 
-> In short, the combination of Html CSS and Javascript is holytrinity.
-> JavaScript adds life to dead webpages just like (He does to you🤐....padhle bhen tera toh khair tu kyun muskura rahi hai haan what?? first Build yourself😙)  
-> It adds behaviour to the web pages. Using javaScript we can actually make boring webpages highly interactive.
-> Initially it was named as LiveScript then MochaScript, finally it was named as JavaScript since Java was a popular programming language of that time so it was named as javaScript.
-> JavaScript is a lightweight,interpreted and compiled programming language.
-> Lightweight programming lanuages are those which consume minimal memory resources, they are easy to implement and have simple syntax.
-> It is both client and server Side Programming language.
-> That is, It can be used for front-end development as well as Back-end development.

So ye tha kuch JavaScript ke baare now lets dive a little into Outputs, variables, operators, conditional statements and much more!
In JavaScript Output can be displayed in four ways they are
--> innerHtml-
--> document.write-
--> window.alert()-
--> console.log()-
=====================
Variables in JavaScript:
Variable is a named memory location.
Variables are containers that store values.
In simple terms, A variable is a name give to memory location.
In javaScript variables can be declared using var let and CONST keyword
note: Javascript is a dynamically typed language
--> let
- It was introduced in ECMA-6.
- variables declared using let keyword cannot be redeclared.
- They are similar to variables declared using var keyword but they have scope constraints.

--> Var
- If varible is declared using var keyword then they have global scope 
- Even if they are declared inside a block they are accessible even outside the block.










*/
let a = 5;
console.log(a);
//var a;  ||cannot redeclare a
a=12;
console.log(a);

var b = 25;
console.log(b);

{
    var c;
    c=9;
    let d = 13;
    console.log(b);
    console.log(a);
}
console.log(c);
let d = 13;
console.log(d);
function myAsyncFunction(){
    console.log('functionwala');
// return "haan bhai hogaya"
}
